## FAQ

### I keep getting "Edited roles hierarchy is too high."

This means that the role you are trying to edit is either higher, or the same as your bot's highest role. You can check this in the "roles" part of the server settings.

### What is that fancy looking box text??

You're likely thinking of Embeds. A tutorial can be found [here](http://discord4j.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Making-embedded-content-using-EmbedBuilder/) on the wiki.

### How to make a music bot?

The best way to do this is to use [Lavaplayer](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer). An example is on the github of how to use it. There is also an example bot (made by decyg) that has it [here](https://github.com/decyg/d4jexamplebot) or you can look at the wiki page [here.](http://discord4j.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Playing-audio/)
