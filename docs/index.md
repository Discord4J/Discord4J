### Help I just want a bot that works!!!

This wiki is written under the assumption that the user wishes to read and understand the various components of D4J. If you just want to import something and then press play and have something that works check out the starter bot here: https://github.com/decyg/d4jexamplebot/

Some example commands are written in the `CommandHandler` class.

If you have any questions or suggestions for the wiki please mention any of the admins on the official D4J help server.
