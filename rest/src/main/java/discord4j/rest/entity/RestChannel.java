     * This is the tale of a woman who spent way too much time implementing this and, in the end, ~~it didn't even
     * matter~~ it's only somewhat okay. This comment will go into lengthy detail on how the current implementation was
     * derived and hopefully what we can expect out of Reactor in the future to make it better or even perfect.
     *
     * Bulk deleting for Discord is tricky. Discord itself has 3 limitations we need to work around; messages cannot be
     * older than 2 weeks, you cannot bulk delete more than 100 messages, and you must supply 2 or more messages. In
     * addition to these limitations, there are limitations the implementation needs to impose on itself. For one,
     * messageIds cannot be cached as the source can be effectively infinite for large channels and cause a OOME. The
     * second limitation is messageIds should not be subscribed multiple times (per subscription of bulkDelete) for the
     * same reason and will likely hit rate limits due to the sheer amount of message fetching if the source is coming
     * from a getMessagesBefore or getMessagesAfter call (the most common use case for this method).
     *
     * With these limitations in mind our options become rather limited. Let's also add that our goal is to be
     * "efficient" which we will define as doing the least amount of bulk delete requests as possible and to be
     * "accurate" which means every eligible message for bulk delete is bulk deleted. Let's consider the options
     * I have thought of and explain why they won't work.
     *
     * The original implementation of this method was the most "efficient" and "accurate". What it did was iterate
     * through messageIds and put all ineligible ones into some Collection then buffer the eligible ones up to 100 then
     * bulk deleted them. After iterating through all messageIds the outstanding buffer is bulk deleted (if there was a
     * collection of 1 left over it was put into ineligible) then it would send out all the ineligible IDs at once. We
     * are "efficient" by only doing requests once we've filled our buffers and we are "accurate" in that no eligible
     * message was counted as ineligible.
     *
     * Splendid!...so why was it changed? Well, the big problem comes from that external Collection. For one, because of
     * how it was setup the insertion wasn't (and couldn't be) done in a thread-safe manner. For List implementations
     * there is no real efficient way to guarantee memory-safety except for copying (CopyOnWriteArrayList, way too much
     * memory and costly performance wise) or synchronizing (which is introducing blocking locks in a reactive
     * environment). The second problem is a lot more damning, for large channels it would OOME. Since for any long-term
     * channel most messages will be older than 2 weeks, so the vast majority of IDs will be put into that Collection.
     * If the source is from an unbounded getMessagesBefore, for example, then for any sufficiently large channel the
     * bot would certainly OOME with no real obvious reason. With these two limitations, this was scraped.
     *
     * The second implementation is almost like the first, but with a small tweak. Instead of a Collection that would
     * hold ineligible IDs and dump them in the end, it was a sink so as ineligible IDs are found they are just
     * immediately sent downstream. Cool! We just solved both of the previous problems at once! But then a new problem
     * arrived, early termination of the chain and thus dropping buffered eligible IDs. Take the following:
     *
     * channel.getMessagesBefore(Snowflake.of(Instant.now()))
     *     .map(Message::getId)
     *     .transform(channel::bulkDelete)
     *     .take(100)
     *
     * The snippet says "keep bulk deleting messages until 100 ineligible messages arrive". Let us assume the channel
     * has 23 eligible messages but has many thousands of ineligible ones. In the implementation I described what would
     * happen is we buffer up the 23 eligible messages, but then we start sending ineligible ones downstream. Once we
     * sent 100, the chain is rightfully cancelled and the buffer just...goes away. We never even bulk deleted! Because
     * once the chain is cancelled you cannot follow it up with another reactive action (the bulk delete) as that
     * doesn't make sense. Now let's say you have 123 eligible messages, you get 100 bulk deleted correctly, but then
     * drop the remaining 23...one can see how this would be incredibly annoying for the end-user. They wouldn't even
     * come back through the Flux! They are just lost...forever.
     *
     * Which leads us to this implementation. Instead of buffering up only eligible IDs instead let's buffer *all* IDs.
     * Once you have a buffer, separate out the eligible ones from the ineligible, do a bulk delete, then send out the
     * ineligible ones. This implementation...works. But it's not the most "accurate" nor "efficient" theoretical way to
     * do this. Let's go into detail why.
     *
     * For the earlier snippet this implementation is perfectly "efficient" and "accurate". Since the messages are
     * ordered (reverse chronologically) all eligible IDs are grouped at once and thus bulk deleted as expected. The
     * rest are sent downstream to be terminated early with little memory penalty. Perfect, and for most users, the use
     * case of using this with a getMessagesBefore is the most common one.
     *
     * For getMessagesAfter it is "efficient", but not really "accurate", but it's only "inaccurate" for a very fringe
     * case. Consider having 152 messages and the first 99 are ineligible, and the rest are eligible. What will happen
     * is the 100th message in the buffer, seeing as it's only 1 message, will be counted as ineligible, when it could
     * have, optimally, been put with the other 51 messages in the next chunk and be bulk deleted. However, the
     * implementation is still "efficient" as bulk deleted messages will be grouped together (just at the end rather
     * than the start).
     *
     * For random cases, yeah, the "accuracy" and "efficiency" will be all over the place. Assuming even distribution of
     * 50 ineligible messages and 50 eligible messages per buffer then our "efficiency" is twice as worse than it could
     * be (doing bulk deletes in sets of 50s instead of 100s). And because eligible messages are not grouped, there can
     * be many cases of lone eligible messages in buffers that will then be counted as ineligible. That said, the chance
     * of the source of messageIds being completely random is a rather fringe case, and the API *does* work as it is
     * stated in the documentation. So I think despite these potential problems, this is acceptable behavior given our
     * goals and many limitations.
     *
     * So how could this all be improved? If simply there was an operation in Reactor where for some buffer operation,
     * if a cancellation happened, whatever is in the buffer is sent out in some capacity and can be worked on in some
     * reactive manner. We could then go back to the second implementation of this method and be perfectly "efficient"
     * and "accurate" with no consequences.
     *
     * And that's it. Wow that was long. Hope you all enjoyed that needlessly large explanation of my rationale that
     * very few will likely read. Oh well. Hope you enjoy fixing this mess. -Dannie
