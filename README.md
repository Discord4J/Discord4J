Java interface for the official [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) API, written in Java 8.
[The API is also available in a few other languages.](https://discordapi.com/unofficial/libs.html)

For the latest dev builds, use the short commit hash or `dev-SNAPSHOT` as your version.

## Adding Discord4J as a dependency for a project
Given that `@VERSION@` = the version of Discord4J (this can either be a release version, the short commit hash or `dev-SNAPSHOT`).
### With Maven
In your `pom.xml` add (without the ellipses):
```xml
...
<repositories>
  ...
  <repository> <!-- This repo fixes issues with transitive dependencies -->
    <id>jcenter</id>
    <url>http://jcenter.bintray.com</url>
  </repository>
  <repository>
    <id>jitpack.io</id>
    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
...
<dependencies>
  ...
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.austinv11</groupId>
    <artifactId>Discord4j</artifactId>
    <version>@VERSION@</version>
   <!-- <classifier>shaded</classifier> <!-- Include this line if you want a shaded jar (all the Discord4J dependencies bundled into one jar)-->
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
...
```
### With Gradle
In your `build.gradle` add (without the ellipses): 
```groovy
...
repositories {
  ...
  jcenter() //This prevents issues with transitive dependencies
  maven {
    url  "https://jitpack.io"
  }
}
...
dependencies {
  ...
  compile "com.github.austinv11:Discord4j:@VERSION@"
  //compile "com.github.austinv11:Discord4j:@VERSION@:shaded" //Use this line instead of the one above it if you want a shaded jar (all the Discord4J dependencies bundled into one jar)
}
...
```
### Manually with the shaded jar
If you don't use Maven nor Gradle (which you really should, because it's a lot more flexible and allows you to update easily), you can always [grab the shaded jar file](http://austinv11.github.io/Discord4J/downloads.html) (which has all the D4J dependencies inside), and link it in your IntelliJ or Eclipse project.
#### IntelliJ
Module Settings > Dependencies > click the + > JARs or directories > Select your JAR file
#### Eclipse
Project Properties > Java Build Path > Add the jar file

## So, how do I use this?

### Starting with the API
The very first thing you need to do is obtain an `IDiscordClient` object. This can be done by using the `ClientBuilder`.
Example:
```java
public class Example {

  public static IDiscordClient createClient(String token, boolean login) { // Returns a new instance of the Discord client
    ClientBuilder clientBuilder = new ClientBuilder(); // Creates the ClientBuilder instance
    clientBuilder.withToken(token); // Adds the login info to the builder
    try {
		if (login) {
      		return clientBuilder.login(); // Creates the client instance and logs the client in
    	} else {
      		return clientBuilder.build(); // Creates the client instance but it doesn't log the client in yet, you would have to call client.login() yourself
    	}
	} catch (DiscordException e) { // This is thrown if there was a problem building the client
		e.printStackTrace();
		return null;
	}
  }
}
```
### Events
The Discord4J library is very event driven. Your bot can detect these events through the use of an event listener. There are two ways of creating an event listener:

1. Using `IListener`:
```java
public class InterfaceListener implements IListener<ReadyEvent> { // The event type in IListener<> can be any class which extends Event
  
  @Override
  public void handle(ReadyEvent event) { // This is called when the ReadyEvent is dispatched
    doCoolStuff();
  }
}
```

2. Using the `@EventSubscriber` annotation:
```java
public class AnnotationListener {
  
  @EventSubscriber
  public void onReadyEvent(ReadyEvent event) { // This method is called when the ReadyEvent is dispatched
    foo();
  }
  
  public void onMessageReceivedEvent(MessageReceivedEvent event) { // This method is NOT called because it doesn't have the @EventSubscriber annotation
    bar();
  }
}
```

Registering your listener:
```java
public class Main {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    IDiscordClient client = Example.createClient(args[0], true); // Gets the client object (from the first example)
    EventDispatcher dispatcher = client.getDispatcher(); // Gets the EventDispatcher instance for this client instance
    dispatcher.registerListener(new InterfaceListener()); // Registers the IListener example class from above
    dispatcher.registerListener(new AnnotationListener()); // Registers the @EventSubscriber example class from above
  }
}
```

### Modules
Discord4J has an API for creating modular Discord Bots! See [Martacus's sample repo](https://github.com/Martacus/Simplecommands/tree/master) for an example as to how it works.

### More examples

## Deprecation policy
Due to the nature of the Discord API, any deprecations found in the API should not be expected to last past the current
 version. Meaning that if a method is deprecated on version 2.1.0, do not assume the method will be available in version 2.2.0.

## Development
The Discord API is still in development. Functions may break at any time.  
In such an event, please contact me or submit a pull request.
