/**
 * Dispatched when a user in a guild interacts with an application command or component. It is recommended you use a
 * subclass in your event listeners to access interaction-specific methods. Application command interactions like
 * {@link ChatInputInteractionEvent}, {@link UserInteractionEvent} and {@link MessageInteractionEvent} are created
 * through Discord REST API, while component interactions like {@link ButtonInteractionEvent} and
 * {@link SelectMenuInteractionEvent} are added to a message as user interface. See a diagram below for the current
 * event hierarchy for interactions.
 * <p>
 * You are required to respond to this interaction within a three-second window by using one of the following:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #reply()} to directly include a message</li>
 *     <li>{@link #deferReply()} to acknowledge without a message, typically to perform a background task and give the
 *     user a loading state until it is edited</li>
 * </ul>
 * After the initial response is complete, you can work with the interaction using the following methods:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #editReply()} to edit the initial response</li>
 *     <li>{@link #getReply()} to fetch the initial response</li>
 *     <li>{@link #deleteReply()} to delete the initial response</li>
 * </ul>
 * You can also work with followup messages using:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #createFollowup()} to create a followup message</li>
 *     <li>{@link #editFollowup(Snowflake)} to update a followup message, given its ID</li>
 *     <li>{@link #deleteFollowup(Snowflake)} to delete a followup message, given its ID</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This is not directly dispatched by Discord, but is a utility specialization of {@link InteractionCreateEvent}.
 *
