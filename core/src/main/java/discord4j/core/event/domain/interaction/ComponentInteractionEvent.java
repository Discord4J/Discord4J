/**
 * Dispatched when a user interacts with a {@link MessageComponent} the bot has sent.
 * <p>
 * You are required to respond to this interaction within a three-second window by using one of the following:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #reply()} to directly include a message</li>
 *     <li>{@link #deferReply()} to acknowledge without a message, typically to perform a background task and give the
 *     user a loading state until it is edited</li>
 *     <li>{@link #edit()} to modify the message the component is on</li>
 *     <li>{@link #deferEdit()} to acknowledge without a message, will not display a loading state and allows later
 *     modifications to the message the component is on</li>
 * </ul>
 * See {@link InteractionCreateEvent} for more details about valid operations.
 * <p>
 * This is not directly dispatched by Discord, but is a utility specialization of {@link InteractionCreateEvent}.
